# py_europass

## What is this?

**py_europass** will be a Python module (intended to be written in both Python2 and Python3) for sending JSON data to Europass interoperability platform and receive an official Europass CV, ESP or CV+ESP file in different possible formats:
- XML
- ODT
- doc (MS-Word2003)

It uses [Europass REST API](http://interop.europass.cedefop.europa.eu/web-services/rest-api-reference/) and http requests.

### Depends:
You will need to install *requests*:
`pip install requests`

### NOTE:
This is still a dirty WIP proof of concept, nothing else. So son't expect it to work as it is.
